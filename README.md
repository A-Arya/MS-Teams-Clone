# MS-Teams-Clone
This web app is a Microsoft Teams clone which enables us to connect two or more users, and have a video and text chat.

The user can either create a meet, or enter a URL to directly join an existing meet.
In the meeting, one can mute/unmute or turn on/off their video.

Technologies used:
1. NodeJS + Express
2. PeerJS WebRTC
3. Socket.io
4. EJS
